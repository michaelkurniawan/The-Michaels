                <p>On the Isle of Berk, the Viking tribe lived in deep fear of dragons. They not only avoided the creatures but also waged war against them regularly. Sven, a young adventurous boy, wasn't entirely convinced that dragons were the true enemy.</p>

                <p>Every day, Sven witnessed the battles between the Viking tribe and the dragons from a distance. Though forbidden to join the fight by his renowned warrior father, Sven remained curious about the dragons. One day, while hiding behind a large rock during a skirmish, he spotted a small wounded dragon abandoned by its pack.</p>

                <p>Without hesitation, Sven approached the injured dragon, whom he named "Blossom" because of the bright pink hue around its wings.
